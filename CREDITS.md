FastBrowse is primarily developed by Jake Steinburger, however it uses a few open source projects, of which the developers are very much appreciated:

* cpp-httplib: Web server library for C++ - Used by FastBrowse to communicate between the frontend and backend.
* Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF): Library for embedding a local chromium browser within an application - Used to create the graphical user interface for FastBrowse.
* The Chromium Project: A modern open source web browser which CEF above is powered by and uses heavily.

The project also uses a non-open source library that I feel provides so much more value that it's free price, which is Font Awesome, a CSS library which is also very useful.
