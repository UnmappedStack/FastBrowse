FastBrowse is primarily developed by Jake Steinburger, however it uses a few open source projects, of which the developers are very much appreciated:

* cpp-httplib: Web server library for C++ - Used by FastBrowse to communicate between the frontend and backend.
* Electron: A HTML renderer and JavaScript engine powered by Chromium which FastBrowse uses to render the frontend's GUI.
* The Chromium Project: A modern open source web browser which CEF above is powered by and uses heavily.
